    <h2>Research</h2>
    <p>My initial scientific curiosity was about top-down processing, reverse synaptic function, and the similarity between photoreceptor segments and synapses as well as the concept of immune deviation. </p><br>

    <p>To me, almost all organs appear to exhibit some aspects of immune deviation or tolerance, since our bodies are constantly exposed to non-self elements such as foods, medication, microbiomes and pathogens, affecting lungs, gastrointestinal tract, blood stream, heart, uterus, testis, and even sensory organs. The brain, however, seems be more isolated ones, like an island surrounded  the water of cerebrospinal fluid. These early questions continue to captivate me; although I had never formally studied them, they fueled my passion to explore further. 
    </p><br>
    <p>In my career, I approached one question at a time, addressing each through experiments I could manage within the labs I worked in.
    </p><br>
    <p>My actual research initially focused on the differences in regenerative capacity between the peripheral and central nervous systems. During physiological psychology classes, we performed spinal cord lesions in rats, and observed axonal sprouting. Subsequently, I assisted with studied on sciatic nerve and optic nerve injuries, which in turn led me to explore immunology. I investigated the application of tolerized macrophages for treating autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis. The lab where I worked utilized models of septic shock, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), rheumatoid arthritis, and various cancers, with a particular focus on non-classical MHC CD1d and NKT in the context of cancer and autoimmunity.  I was the first member in the lab to establish EAE model, and implement tolerized antigen presenting cells (Tol-APC) applications.  
    </p><br>
    <p>This research journey guided me to delve deeper into brain anatomy and ultimately brought me back to the retina, where my initial curiosity had first taken root. </p><br>

    <p>For over 15 years, I have worked as a basic and translational scientist in both academia and industry, studying the retina, especially photoreceptor synapses, and a mutation derived retina degenerations, and then using chemicals such as oxidized lipids, sodium iodate and cisplatin, I developed animal models of macular degeneration. I also participated in testing candidate therapeutics including small molecules, nano-conjugated compounds, antibodies and antibody-derived fragments, exosomes, and AAVs. My goal has been to identify anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory, and anti-angiogenic agents for treating chronic retina diseases such as age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma, and diabetic retinopathy. Additionally, I contributed to research on corneal diseases and other organ pathologies, including kidney, and liver injuries.</p><br>
 
    <p>While exosome and AAV based therapeutic developments are still in the early stages, I find them quite fascinating to me in immunologic aspect and AAV engineering, which includes both genetic and protein design, has also inspired me to acquire new computational skills. Even now, I continue to learn and expand my expertise, although I do not know this efforts give rewards or not. </p>
